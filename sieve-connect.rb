  # Linuxbrew users:
  # I can't support Linuxbrew, sorry.
  #
  # At present, to use this formula I got as far as:
  #   sudo apt install libz-dev
  #   brew install sieve-connect --without-readline --with-brew-perl
  # and it then breaks because I need to manually add Module::Build and then
  # probably a host of other packages to the list I need to manually maintain
  # below, which then means I'm responsible for the security audit of those
  # when I tell people "use this checksum".
  #
  # This is not viable.  Sorry, I'm not jumping through those hoops on my own
  # time to satisfy a broken model of "every single app developer needs to
  # manually supply checksums and code audit for each part of what's normally
  # a system library".
  #
  # Brew is not suitable for installing Perl apps.  It's becoming less suitable
  # but still just about viable on macOS and I'm tempted to pull it from this
  # tap.  It's not viable for me on Linuxbrew at this time.
  #
  # Please install via OS packages, or directly from the git repo.


  # The crashing comes from bugs in the GSSAPI code; there's a fix in the
  # bug-tracker for the GSSAPI project, but there's been no release in a few years.
  # If you locally fix the GSSAPI module, then you can have stable GSSAPI in
  # Perl on macOS, but that's not the default.
  #
  # The upstream sieve-connect package is multi-OS and GSSAPI support is a core
  # feature, so it's not getting disabled by default there.  Patching for a
  # default-broken platform belongs in the package manager used, and is why the
  # upstream author provides this Formula.
  #
  # But sieve-connect does provide a blacklist mechanism.
  # So we patch.

  # drop HEAD support, or we stick to the old API.
  # We stick to the old API.  When Homebrew removes it, we'll drop HEAD
  # support.
